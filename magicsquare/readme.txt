cat makefile to see that there are four rules (with four targets with corresponding commands.)

Do not need to use mscheckermt2.cpp, which contains more code (which doesn't improve the multithreading part). 
The mscheckermt2.cpp file contains some statements relating to dynamic memory releasing. Currently my starter code deals only half threads, so the code needs to be modified once you have the other half threads launched.
So, unless you have extra energy, do not worry about mscheckermt2.cpp. 


Use the other two cpp files as reference to complete your assignment.
